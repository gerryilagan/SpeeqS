# SpeeqS
SpeeqS is a framework project whose mission is to create a set of hardware and software that can be repetitively used to make electronics projects primarily focused on the Internet of Things. 

One of its objectives is not to reinvent the wheel but to use existing hardware or software. 

Using such hardware/software and combining them together to form a platform for creating electronics projects in general and Internet of Things projects in particular.
